# Gesturo - Sign Learning Application

In Indonesia, there is a sizeable deaf population of around 2 million people. Deaf individuals face challenges in communicating and obtaining information because sign language is not a common language spoken in the community. Therefore, it is difficult for them to communicate with people who are not fluent in sign language. And vice versa. Many members of the general public do not understand sign language, making it difficult to communicate and interact with them. The lack of accessibility and resources to learn sign language for people who are interested, the lack of sign language teaching personnel, and the lack of sign language learning applications that utilize the latest technology are our reasons for creating and developing this application.

The creation of sign language learning and translation apps is crucial to improving the quality of life for the deaf community and promoting social inclusion. This app has the potential to bring positive change to the lives of millions of people. By developing this app, we are optimistic that we can help create a more just and inclusive society for everyone, including the deaf.
